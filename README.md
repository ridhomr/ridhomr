<h1>Hello! I'm a wave ridhomr</h1><br>
I am a web developer & security and I am an informatics student at a university in Yogyakarta. I build my skill stack in public and share open source knowledge via github, and the medium I write on https://ridhomarhaban2000.medium.com/ I hope to encourage people to learn openly and fearlessly, with childlike neglect wild.
